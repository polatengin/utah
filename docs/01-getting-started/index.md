Welcome to Utah! This section will help you get up and running with the Utah language quickly and efficiently.

## What is Utah?

Utah is a CLI tool that allows you to write shell scripts using TypeScript-like syntax. It transpiles your `.shx` files into clean, readable bash scripts that can run on any POSIX-compliant system.

## Why Utah?

- **Type Safety**: Write shell scripts with type annotations and catch errors early
- **Modern Syntax**: Use familiar TypeScript-like syntax instead of bash quirks
- **Rich Built-ins**: Access powerful functions for JSON/YAML, file systems, web APIs, and more
- **Better Error Handling**: Use try/catch blocks for robust error management
- **Parallel Execution**: Run functions concurrently for better performance
