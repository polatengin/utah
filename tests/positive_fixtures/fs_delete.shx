// Test fs.delete() as both expression and statement

// Statement usage - delete a file
fs.delete("temp.txt");

// Statement usage with variables
let filePath = "data/old-file.log";
fs.delete(filePath);

// Delete directory
fs.delete("old-folder");

// Expression usage - check if delete was successful
let success = fs.delete("config.json");
console.log(success);

// Expression usage in conditional
if (fs.delete("template.html")) {
  console.log("File deleted successfully");
} else {
  console.log("File delete failed");
}

// Delete with nested paths
fs.delete("logs/archive/old-data.csv");

// Using expressions as paths
let filename = "temporary.txt";
let tempDir = "temp";
fs.delete(tempDir + "/" + filename);

// Delete with dynamic paths
let timestamp = "2024-01-15";
fs.delete("backups/backup-" + timestamp + ".tar.gz");

// Complex path expressions
let projectDir = "old-projects";
let projectName = "deprecated";
